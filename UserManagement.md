## Authentication Flow

- **Microsoft Login**:

  - Session tokens are stored securely
- **Custom Login**:
  - Passwords are hashed using Django's `make_password`
  - Validated using Djangoâ€™s authentication backend

---

## Deployment

- Dockerized for consistency and scalability
- Deployed on Azure Web App with PostgreSQL backend
- Static files served via Django's staticfiles config

---

## Admin Use Case

1. Log in via Microsoft SSO or admin credentials
2. View and manage user accounts (delete/ban/create)
