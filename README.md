# Demo to test integrating two projects

The idea is create a landing page let user pick which team front end they want to use. This just to keep both team front-end but back end need further adjustment.

login is working for both microsoft and regular login
register is also working
since I used trois project back end, uranium side still need more adjustment

# To test the demo:

#1 Set up venv if you want to use it 
#2 pip install -r requirements.txt
#3 download env file, adjust it to your local db and put it in root: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ur6PS5JKRTOn3OWM0o7Dg-NkggFfO37O/view?usp=sharing
Note that some packages may missing, just pip install it and add it to requirement
#4 python manage.py runserver or python3 manage.py runserver
#5 cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
